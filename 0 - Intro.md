Introduction
============

Elixir is built on top of the Erlang VM. Most of the system-level concepts that will be explained in this article are taken directly from Erlang: processes, messages, modules, functions. In the text, Erlang will be mentioned every time one of its concepts is explained. Elixir will only be mentioned where an Elixir-specific feature is described.
